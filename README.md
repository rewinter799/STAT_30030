# STAT_30030

Various numerical assignments from STAT 30030 (Statistical Theory and Methods Ia) at UChicago.

* In Homework 2, Exercise 7, we implement rejection sampling to generate data distributed ~Beta(2,2) from randomly generated Uniform[0,1] data.
* In Homework 3, Exercise 6, we explore the bias, variance, mean squared error, and asymptotic distributions of two estimators of the exponential distribution's rate parameter: (1) the classic method of moments estimator, and (2) an alternative method of moments estimator derived from the second population and sample moments.
*  In Homework 5, Exercise 5, we generate three confidence intervals for the rate parameter of the exponential distribution (one using the MLE's asymptotic distribution, one using its exact (Gamma) distribution, and one using the bootstrap) and compare the coverage of each.
